We are an open group of students, professionals, `.*`, with `10` things in common:

<ol start="0">
  <li>InfoSec</li>
  <li>35°00'00.0"N 33°00'00.0"E</li>
</ol>

Our shared goal is to learn and practice our InfoSec skills in a collaborative and fun environment.
We usually do that by participating in CTF competitions, meetups, and workshops.
